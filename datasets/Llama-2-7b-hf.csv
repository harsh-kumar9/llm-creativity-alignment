But, don't just list them. Describe them. What do you think they would look like? What would they sound like? What would they feel like? What would they smell like? How would they be used? Be as descriptive as possible. You can type in FIVE ideas, but creative quality is more important than quantity. It's better to have a few really good ideas than a lot of uncreative ones"".
