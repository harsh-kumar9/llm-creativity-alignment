You can use any type of tire, including car tires, bicycle tires, motorcycle tires, and so on. You can also use any type of tire-related product, such as tire inner tubes, tire pressure gauges, tire inflators, and so on.
If you are having trouble coming up with ideas, try to think of things that you would do with a tire if you had no other options. For example, if you were stranded on a desert island, what would you do with a tire? Or if you were a poor farmer in a developing country, how would you use a tire? Or if you were a homeless person, how would you use a tire?
