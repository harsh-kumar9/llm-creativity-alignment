The goal is to come up with creative ideas, which are ideas that strike people as clever, unusual, interesting, uncommon, humorous, innovative, or different. Your ideas don't have to be practical or realistic; they can be silly or strange, even, so long as they are creative uses rather than ordinary uses. You can type in FIVE ideas, but creative quality is more important than quantity. It's better to have a few really good ideas than a lot of uncreative ones.
To make a good creative use, you must use your imagination to come up with an idea that is not obvious and is not something that would be thought of by most people. For example, if you think of an idea that most people would think of, you should try to think of a different or better way of doing it. You should also avoid thinking of ideas that are common and ordinary, such as using a shoe as a hammer or a shoe as a weapon.
You can also get points for creative ideas that are similar to ones that have already been posted, but you must come up with a different way of doing it. For example, if someone has already posted an idea for using a shoe as a hammer, you can get points for posting a different idea, such as using a shoe as a hammer to hit a nail into a wall.
If you want to get the most points possible, you should try to come up with as many different and creative uses as possible. You should also try to come up with ideas that are unique and original. If you can come up with an idea that is both creative and unique, you will get the most points possible.
